Okay, here is a comprehensive outline for reviewing and integrating the remaining features with the backend services:

**Phase 3: Integrate Core Features**

1.  **Custom Food Management (`FoodDB` screens, `customFoodService`)**
    *   **Goal:** Allow users to create, view, update, and delete their own custom food entries.
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/services/customFoodService.ts`
        *   `src/screens/FoodDB/index.tsx` (or list view)
        *   `src/screens/FoodDB/add.tsx` (or create/edit view)
        *   `src/screens/FoodDB/search.tsx` (if applicable to custom foods)
        *   Potentially related hooks (e.g., `src/hooks/useFoodDBList.ts`, `src/hooks/useFoodDBAddForm.ts`).
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **Review `customFoodService.ts`:**
            *   Verify interface (`CustomFood`?) matches the Supabase table schema.
            *   Confirm existence and correctness of CRUD functions (`getCustomFoods`, `addCustomFood`, `updateCustomFood`, `deleteCustomFood`). Ensure they use the correct table and user ID filtering.
        *   **Review `FoodDB/index.tsx` (List View):**
            *   Check how the list of custom foods is fetched. Is it using a hook? Does the hook call `getCustomFoods` from the service?
            *   Replace any mock data fetching with calls to the service/hook.
            *   Verify loading and error states are handled.
        *   **Review `FoodDB/add.tsx` (Add/Edit View):**
            *   Analyze the form submission logic. Does it call `addCustomFood` (for new items) or `updateCustomFood` (for existing items) from the service?
            *   Ensure the data passed to the service matches the required `AddCustomFoodData` or `UpdateCustomFoodData` types.
            *   Check if form management hooks correctly interact with the service. Replace mock submissions.
            *   Verify loading/error handling during save.
        *   **Review `FoodDB/search.tsx`:**
            *   Determine its exact function (search user's custom foods? External DB?).
            *   If searching custom foods, ensure it uses an appropriate filtering/query function (might need adding to `customFoodService.ts` or handled client-side after fetching all).

2.  **Settings Screen (`Settings` screen, `profileService`, `authService`)**
    *   **Goal:** Allow users to view/update their profile information and log out.
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/screens/Settings/index.tsx`
        *   `src/services/profileService.ts` (already reviewed, but check usage)
        *   `src/services/auth/authService.ts` (already reviewed, but check usage)
        *   Potentially `src/hooks/useSettingsForm.ts` or similar.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **Review `Settings/index.tsx`:**
            *   Identify UI elements for displaying/editing profile data (name, goals, etc.).
            *   Check how initial profile data is loaded. Does it use `getProfile` (likely via a hook or context)? Replace mock data.
            *   Analyze the "Save" or "Update Profile" logic. Does it call `updateProfile` with the correct partial `Profile` data?
            *   Verify loading/error states for fetching and updating.
            *   Locate the "Logout" button/action. Confirm it calls `signOut` from `authService.ts`. Check for appropriate state updates (e.g., clearing Redux state, navigation).

3.  **Progress Screen (`Progress` screen, `weightLogService`, `profileService`, etc.)**
    *   **Goal:** Display user progress metrics, primarily weight history and potentially goal attainment.
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/screens/Progress/index.tsx`
        *   `src/hooks/useWeightHistoryData.ts` (already integrated)
        *   `src/services/profileService.ts` (for goals)
        *   `src/services/foodLogService.ts` (if showing calorie/macro trends)
        *   Potentially `src/hooks/useProgressChartData.ts` or similar.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **Review `Progress/index.tsx`:**
            *   Identify displayed metrics (weight chart, progress towards goals, calorie history?).
            *   **Weight Data:** Confirm it uses `useWeightHistoryData` correctly and handles its `isLoading` and `error` states.
            *   **Goal Data:** Check how user goals (e.g., target weight, calorie goal) are fetched. Ensure it uses `getProfile` (directly or via a hook/context). Replace mock goal data.
            *   **Calorie/Macro Data (If applicable):** Determine if historical food log data is displayed. If so, ensure it's fetched appropriately (e.g., calling `getFoodLogsByDate` for a range, potentially needing a new service function for aggregated data over time). Replace mock data.
            *   Verify loading/error states for all data sources.

**Phase 4: Define and Integrate Optional Features**

4.  **Exercise Feature (`Exercise` screen)**
    *   **Goal:** Allow users to log exercises (scope TBD).
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/screens/Exercise/index.tsx`
        *   Potentially `src/services/exerciseLogService.ts` (NEW)
        *   Potentially `src/hooks/useExerciseLog.ts` (NEW)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **Define Scope:** Clarify *what* exercise data needs logging (e.g., type, duration, distance, sets/reps, calories burned?).
        *   **Define Schema:** Based on scope, define the `ExerciseLog` interface and the corresponding Supabase table schema.
        *   **Create `exerciseLogService.ts`:** Implement CRUD functions (`addExerciseLog`, `getExerciseLogsByDate`, etc.) interacting with the new Supabase table, ensuring user ID filtering.
        *   **Integrate with UI:**
            *   Update `Exercise/index.tsx` (or create hooks) to fetch and display logs using the new service.
            *   Implement the UI/form for logging exercises.
            *   Ensure the form submission calls `addExerciseLog`.
            *   Handle loading/error states.

5.  **Subscription Feature (`Subscription` screen)**
    *   **Goal:** Handle premium features/subscriptions (scope and method TBD).
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/screens/Subscription/index.tsx`
        *   Potentially `src/services/subscriptionService.ts` (NEW)
        *   Potentially Supabase Functions for webhook handling.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **Define Strategy:** Choose the implementation method (Supabase table + Payment Provider Webhooks, RevenueCat SDK, Expo IAP, Stripe SDK).
        *   **Implement Backend (If needed):**
            *   Set up necessary Supabase tables (e.g., `user_subscriptions`).
            *   Create Supabase Functions to handle webhooks from payment providers (e.g., Stripe) to update subscription status in the table.
            *   Configure payment provider (Stripe, App Store Connect, Google Play Console).
        *   **Implement Client-Side Service (`subscriptionService.ts` or SDK wrapper):**
            *   Create functions to:
                *   Fetch current subscription status/entitlements (either from Supabase table or SDK).
                *   Initiate purchase flows (using SDK or redirecting to Stripe Checkout).
                *   Restore purchases (if using SDKs).
        *   **Integrate with UI:**
            *   Update `Subscription/index.tsx` to use the service/wrapper to display current status and available plans.
            *   Implement buttons/actions to trigger purchase/restore flows via the service.
            *   Handle loading/error states.
            *   Implement logic elsewhere in the app to gate features based on subscription status retrieved from the service.

**Phase 5: Final Pass**

6.  **Review and Refine:**
    *   Perform a final check across all integrated services, hooks, and screens.
    *   Search for any remaining mock data, simulations, or `TODO` comments related to backend calls.
    *   Ensure consistent error handling patterns (e.g., displaying user-friendly messages, logging errors).
    *   Verify loading states are handled gracefully in the UI.

This outline provides a structured approach to integrating the remaining features. We can tackle them one by one. Which area would you like to start with? **Custom Food Management** seems like a good next step.
