// This file might become redundant if all specific DB logic moves to other services.
// For now, it just exports the Supabase client.

// --- Add other database service functions below ---
// e.g., for food logs, weight logs, custom foods, etc.
// --> These should now go into their respective service files (foodLogService.ts, etc.)
